# Dining Halls Project

## Overview
This is a website that pulls the daily menu items from the [USC dining hall menus site](http://hospitality.usc.edu/residential-dining-menus/) and displays them on the website in a simple manner.  It departs from the current USC website by allowing users to filter by dietary restriction directly on the website.

## Purpose
This project serves as practice in:
- Building a REST API using Express JS and MongoDB
- Creating a responsive front-end using React JS
- Scraping a website for content using Express JS

Planned future additions:
- Letting users favorite dishes and then be notified when their favorites are being served
- Allowing users to leave comments and reviews on specific dishes
- Creating a way for users to connect and interact through the website

## Viewing Instrucitons
To be updated... I'm currently in the process of moving this project to a live server, but please feel free to checkout out the code in the meantime!
